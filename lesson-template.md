## Introduction 
The Introduction is a level 2 heading. Any level 2 heading is a standalone page in Canvas.

The introduction should:
Pick up where the underlying module narrative left off 
Note the current status of the project
Screenshot of current state of the project
Shape/advance the narrative to align with the scope of work for this lesson
I.e., what plot twist or plot development trick can anchor this lesson’s scope of work in a real-world scenario?
Describe the lesson project. 
Create and screenshot a fictional GitHub issue the hero might see. Some example phrases:
The design team has created a GitHub issue to… and attached this mock-up…
Marketing worked with design to drive more leads… Design created this issue for us… attached this mockup…
The director of technology wants us to create a back-end for our site. She created this issue with the specifications…
If a mock-up is provided as part of the narrative, include a screenshot
If given a mock-up or specs, analyze the details of the mock-up
Where relevant, draw connections between what students will do and relevance/authenticity of this type of work or skills learned. 
In the real world, these type of requests happen all the time, particularly when...
In the real world as a developer, you will use these skills to x, y, z
In the real world as a developer, you actually will do things a little differently than we are here. 
Explain, where relevant, what skills students will build on from the previous lesson(s):
Revisit previous lesson topics that this lesson will build on or contrast with. Some example phrases:
In the previous lesson, we introduced typography styles, which we’ll now extend. This will help us ______
In the previous lesson, we introduced directories, and we’ll now make a more complex directory structure. This will help us ______
In the previous lesson, we worked in a single branch and now we’re going to explore developing multiple branches. This will help us ______.

Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
Lesson objective
Lesson objective
Lesson objective
Lesson objective
Etc. 

## Preview 
The Preview is a level 2 heading. Any level 2 heading is a standalone page in Canvas.

A preview of the end product of the lesson. This is planned redundancy.

Note that if a mock-up was provided as part of the narrative, it should have been presented in the Introduction. This preview is different; it is an actual screenshot of the completed project. If there is no mock-up, this preview will serve as the graphical reference to guide the project goals. (Refer to it as “the screenshot of the completed project,” rather than “the mock-up.”)

Game Plan: 

To help develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, we provide the opportunity for students to plan out how they would complete the scope of work for the lesson. This is intended to build up the skill to think through and explain how you would go about solving a problem without direction, a scenario students might get in interviews. Because students don’t have the prerequisite knowledge to do this right away, we will scaffold towards this ability:

Game Plan for Modules 1–4: 
We provide the steps students will take to build a scope of work in the lesson. 
We ask students to pause and consider why we are taking this strategy/order. 
After the pause, we provide a brief explanation of why we are taking this strategy/order to build our scope of work. 
In module 1, we explain what a game plan is and that these are designed to develop problem solving skills over the course of the bootcamp that you’ll apply in interviews (“tell me how you would solve the following challenge”) and your new career (like a vague user story)


Game Plan for Modules 5–6: 
Game Plan formats we can take:
We provide a sortable list where students can drag steps into the order they think is correct. In this interaction, two of the steps are out of order in how the list is presented initially to students.
Feedback is general and not answer specific. 
We provide two contrasting gameplans and students have to pick the best gameplan. 
There is a clear right and wrong.
Feedback is general, explaining why one answer is correct and the other is not.
We provide a game plan, and the student has to identify the step that is an error 
Feedback is general and not answer-specific. 

Game Plan for Modules 9–14
We provide a sortable list where students can drag steps into the order they think is correct. In this interaction, all but one of the steps are out of order in how the list is presented initially to students.
We provide two contrasting gameplans and students have to pick the best gameplan. 
The separation between right and wrong is less obvious than in modules 5-6. 

Game Plan for Modules 17–19
We provide a gameplan that has 1 or 2 “blank/s”. Students have to fill in these blanks via text input.
We provide our approach, noting that there may be multiple ways of going about this challenge. 
Students are prompted to reflect about 


Game Plan for Modules 20-22
Students input the steps they would take as text. 
We offer how we will be tackling the scope ahead. We encourage students to self-assess what they wrote against our answer. “How close is your strategy to the approach we’ll take? Reach out to your TA if you see a large discrepancy between the two.” 

Important. Create a Jira issue clearly specifying the requirements for the drag-and-drop assessment that is required for the Game Plan. Make sure that the Jira issue contains the assessment title, as described next. For example, “Assessment: 9.2 Gameplan”.

The syntax for the Gameplan placeholder is:

> **Asset Needed:** Assessment X.Y Gameplan [FSFO-XXX](url of jira issue)

where X represents the module number and Y represents the lesson number. For example:

> **Asset Needed:** Assessment 9.2 Gameplan [FSFO-205](https://trilogyed.atlassian.net/browse/FSFO-205?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZWZlNGY3YTJmMjZkNGI2MGJkODY2OGFiNDVhZTQ2MTYiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)

This is consistent with the syntax described in the Assessments section below, with the exception that there is no sequence number (e.g., 9.2.1), because the Gameplan is always the first assessment. See the Assessments section for details about creating the related Jira issue.

Things to Consider When Writing the Gameplan:
Encourage students to think about what steps they would take to go from current to end product (if they have the appropriate skill level to do this).
Feedback 
There’s more than one way to do this. 
If there are more than two ways to go about the build, briefly discuss 1-2 different strategies the student could use, and explain why we’re going with the strategy we’ve chosen. 
List each step w/ a summary overview:
“Here’s how we’re going to approach this:” (or similar introduction)

Build Step
Summary
1. Verb ____ Example: 1. Create a Style Sheet
What student will do and what learning objective is taking place. 
“Create a style sheet with basic typography by _learning objective_.”

2. Verb ____
What student will do and what learning objective is taking place.
Publish to GitHub pages by __learning objective_

3. Verb ____



Repeat for each step:
## Step X <Verb____> 
Steps are level 2 headings. Any level 2 heading is a standalone page in Canvas.

This contains the step content. It is a shortened version of the Preview steps (often the first sentence in a preview step). 
Special Cases
Most level 2 headings will be straightforward steps. There are some special cases:

See Concept Heading for guidelines about non-step headings. 
See Project Setup Step Template if this is the first step.
See Guidelines for Writing the Last Mile if this step is in the last third of the last lesson.
Concept Headings
Conceptual headings are allowed as level-3 headings within level-2 step headings (e.g., “Let the Games Begin” or “Introducing Variables”). They can help break up and organize explanatory content.
Project Setup Step Template
If this is the first lesson in a module, include instructions for setting up the project. Use a variation of the following content:
## Set Up the Project in GitHub
As we do with every new project, we'll start by creating a GitHub repository and cloning it on our local machine. Then we'll create GitHub issues to define the requirements for each feature. Finally, we'll create feature branches to work in.

1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `<repo-name>`. Make it a public repository and check the box for "Initialize this repository with a README".

2. Go to the Issues tab and create the following issue(s) to make feature branches from (you can cut and paste the Markdown below):

```md
Title: <issue-name>

**Description**

- <Lorem ipsum>

- <Lorem ipsum>

```

(List additional issues as necessary.)

3. At the command line, use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you will clone the repository.

4. Clone the repository using the `git clone` command.

5. Use the `cd` command once more to go to the newly created directory for your repository.

6. In the command line, create a `develop` branch that will store completed work before merging into the `master` branch. The following command will create this branch and check it out:

```bash
git checkout -b develop
```

7. Next, create a feature branch for the initial project code:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
```

> **Hint:** Don't forget to use the `git branch` command to confirm what the active branch is.

Now that we know where we’ll store things and write our code, let's move on to creating the project files.

Intra-Lesson Assessments
While writing, look for opportunities to insert assessments to reinforce topics. Create a Jira issue that clearly describes the assessment. As they will almost always be multiple choice (Gameplans excepted), include all answers, right and wrong, and clearly indicate which ones are correct. The Jira issue is the primary resource for creating assessments in Canvas.

Some more notes about creating an assessment Jira issue:

Title the issue “Assessment: X.Y.Z Title” where X is the module, Y is the lesson, and Z is the assessment’s chronological position in the lesson. The title should be brief, but uniquely identify this assessment. For example, “Assessment: 9.2.1 Template Strings”. 
Apply the labels "learnosity" and "instructional-design"
Apply the appropriate Epic for the module. 

Once you have a Jira issue, the placeholder syntax in the lesson should be:

> **Asset Needed:** Assessment X.Y.Z Brief-But-Unique Title [FSFO-XXX](url of jira issue)

For example:

> **Asset Needed:** Assessment 9.2.1 Template Strings [FSFO-205](https://trilogyed.atlassian.net/browse/FSFO-205?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZWZlNGY3YTJmMjZkNGI2MGJkODY2OGFiNDVhZTQ2MTYiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)

Once the Atomic Assessment’s (Learnosity) assessment id is determined, this placeholder will get replaced by the syntax to automatically create an assessment in Canvas:

!assessment: uNiqu31teMiD

This will almost always happen after the lesson has been merged into staging.
End-of-Lesson Assessments
At the end of each lesson, include an End-of-Lesson Assessment. Similar to the Gameplan assessment, do not include a position number, as it will always be the last assessment in a lesson.

The End-of-Lesson Assessment should squarely target learning objectives for the lesson. Other than that, it’s a typical multiple choice assessment.

The placeholder syntax will be:

> **Asset Needed:** Assessment X.Y End of Lesson [FSFO-XXX](url of jira issue)

where X represents the module number and Y represents the lesson number. For example:

> **Asset Needed:** Assessment 9.2 End of Lesson [FSFO-205](https://trilogyed.atlassian.net/browse/FSFO-205?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZWZlNGY3YTJmMjZkNGI2MGJkODY2OGFiNDVhZTQ2MTYiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)
Videos
While writing, look for opportunities to enhance the instructional value of a lesson with a conceptual or walkthrough video. The corresponding Jira issue should provide a thorough brief for the script writer and production staff. If example code should be displayed in the video, include a zip file with everything necessary for production to set it up, as well as instructions. 
Conceptual Videos
Conceptual videos will be recorded by our celebrity talking heads. They should have a long shelf-life, so that if lesson details change but the learning objectives and topics remain the same, the videos will still be relevant.

There are two flavors of conceptual videos. High-level, and low-level.

A high-level conceptual video should cover a topic generally. For example, “How to Use MDN Web Docs to Learn JavaScript,” “Client-Server Model.” These should be able to stand by themselves as valuable resources on YouTube.

A low-level conceptual video gets more into the nuts and bolts of a concept. For example, “CSS Cascade,” “Functions (Declarations vs. Expressions),” “jQuery UI.” While these may be able to stand on their own outside of our course, they should be closely tied to a lesson’s learning objectives and topics. If they prescribe a way of doing something (for example, Git Workflow), it should follow what we prescribe in the lesson. Demonstrations and examples should reiterate what the lessons cover, without displaying actual lesson code.

The syntax for conceptual video placeholders is:

> **Asset Needed:** Video-Conceptual [FSFO-XXX](url of jira issue)
Walkthrough Videos
Walkthrough videos will be screencasts, not voiced-over by our celebrity talking heads. These will be step-by step instructions on how to perform a task closely related to our lesson projects. Examples include “Google Maps Iframe,” “CSS Overrides,” “Git Merge,” “Dynamically Generating HTML,” “Bootstrap Grid Layout.” These videos encourage the student to follow along with the walkthrough. They should not include actual lesson project code; they should reinforce the practical concepts in the lesson.

The syntax for walkthrough video placeholders is:

> **Asset Needed:** Video-Walkthrough [FSFO-XXX](url of jira issue)
Guidelines for Writing The Last Mile
“The Last Mile” refers to the last third of the last lesson in every module. It’s where we back off on handholding instructions and let the students figure more things out for themselves. 

Before writing your sketch, follow steps 1 and 2
Step 1: Review
Scan the previous 2 Last Miles before writing
Are students given slightly less guidance in the most recent Last Mile? (~5% less guidance each module is something to shoot for)
Are scaffolds used to assist where it’s needed and not where it’s not?
Scaffolds should be used to support students through struggles that are productive to achieving learning outcomes
If something is a struggle, but not necessarily important to achieving the learning outcomes of this lesson, provide step-by-step guidance. 
Step 2: Sketch 
Of the work that remains in the last mile:
What is outside the current skill level of the average student?
If areas exist that are outside their skill level, how can they be simplified or removed entirely?
What can a large majority of students do by themselves?
In these scenarios, tell them what to do and why without guidance on how. 
Important: Anticipate what questions students might have as a result of withholding the how and write 3 quick Q and As. These will help TAs quickly answer common questions and help us control what advice is given. 
Of what work remains, what can students do with some help?
If an answer to this question is not related or not critical to what students need to learn from this lesson, don’t scaffold, just give them step-by-step directions.  
If an answer to this question is critical to the learning outcomes of this lesson, then scaffold. 


Step 3: Outline the Last Mile
Outline how you’ll write the Last Mile for this module. 
The scope of work for the Last Mile is _________. 
What text option will intro the Last Mile with? Here are several options. 
These areas are too difficult for students to do even with help:
Placeholder example
These areas can afford to have less student guidance than in previous lessons
Placeholder example
Placeholder example
Placeholder example
These areas are difficult for students, but not essential to achieving learning outcomes:

These areas are difficult, but possible to do with some scaffolding. 
Placeholder example
Placeholder example
Placeholder example
For each example, describe:
The scaffolding strategy you’ll use. 
How the ‘uplift’ is appropriate for the phase students are in.
Some potential scaffolding strategies include:
Break a complex task down into manageable sub-tasks. 
Ex: Pause: this might seem like a lot of work to do. Pseudocode this section of work into the steps you’ll need to take.
Phase 1 (before project 1): show up to 80% of an answer pseudocode
Phase 2 (before project 2):  show up to 50% of the answer pseudocode
Phase 3 (before project 3): show up to 10% of the answer pseudocode
Provide an example of what you would like to see. 
Ex: Story Time: The request from [insert jerk] is a little vague. You ask your product manager for more clarity and she provides this [paper wireframe]
Phase 1: example is 80% of what the final product should look like
E.g., this wireframe plus some social links
Phase 2: example is 50% of what the final product should look like:
E.g., a paper prototype plus these components
Phase 3: example is described in text alone
E.g., “add a part where the checkout page shows items you previously viewed.”
Connect current knowledge with their prior knowledge.
Ex: Connect the Dots: Fortunately this looks a lot like what we learned/did in lesson [#]. Remember how we [relevant piece of prior knowledge]. We can apply it here, too.
Phase 1: Draws connections and expands on the relevance of the connection. 
Phase 2: Draws connections to relevant material covered previously and prompts the student to expand independently on the relevance of these connections. 
Phase 3: Prompts/encourages this metacognition but does not draw connections or expand on the relevance. 
Help them organize their thoughts before approaching a task.
Ex: Pause: [consider _____ and how it might affect the performance of the feature or consider this aspect of agile and what you should do here ____. 

## Reflection

Congratulate the learner (Great work!, Congratulations! Pat yourself on the back, etc.). Recap what they accomplished during the lesson from a bigger perspective in a couple of sentences.
In this lesson, you added the following skills to your tool belt, knowledge base, skillset (or something like that), then list the technical skills/tools/code they learned. (Reiterate the objectives outlined in the Introduction, but try not to do so verbatim.)
Skill learned in 1-2 sentences
Skill learned in 1-2 sentences
Skill learned in 1-2 sentences
Etc.
If this is the last lesson in a module, recap the entire module
If this is not the last lesson in a module, introduce the next lesson and how it will build on the skills in this lesson.
